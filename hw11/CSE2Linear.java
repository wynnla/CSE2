Homework 11
Assignment: Write a program called CSE2Linear.java that prompts the user to enter 15 ints 
for studentsâ€™ final grades in CSE2. Check that the user only enters ints, and print an error 
message if the user enters anything other than an int.  Print a different error message for 
an int that is out of the range from 0-100, and finally a third error message if the int is 
not greater than or equal to the last int.  Print the final input array.  Next, prompt the 
user to enter a grade to be searched for. Use linear search to find the entered grade. 
Indicate if the grade was found or not, and print out the number of iterations used. 

Next, scramble the sorted array randomly, and print out the scrambled array. 
Prompt the user again to enter an int to be searched for, and use linear search
to find the grade. Indicate if the grade was found or not, and how many iterations it took.
